## **Based on Python Development Jobs**

### **OOP Concepts**

1. **Question**: Can you explain key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles? How have you applied these concepts in past projects?

   * **Answer**: OOP principles such as **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** are foundational for building modular and maintainable code. In my past role at Anuvu, I applied these principles while developing microservices by using **encapsulation** to hide internal data structures, and **inheritance** for code reuse across different API layers. For example, I created a base class for API response handling and extended it across multiple services, simplifying our codebase and improving maintainability.

### **Webservices & API Development**

2. **Question**: Can you describe a time when you built and consumed APIs using Python? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

   * **Answer**: I developed and consumed multiple APIs in my role at **Solut Pvt. Ltd.**, building an internal API for on-field agents to access data securely. One challenge was ensuring API scalability, which I overcame by optimizing **asynchronous requests** and handling **load balancing** through proper endpoint management. I also made use of **Flask** for RESTful API development and **Postman** for testing.

### **Python in Application Development**

3. **Question**: How have you used Python to solve complex application-level problems?

   * **Answer**: In my project at Anuvu, I used Python to handle **data transformation** and **ETL** processes, where I built modules to process large datasets in real-time. For example, I wrote Python programs that integrated with Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for efficient numerical operations, automating data transformation tasks that previously required manual effort.

### **Multithreading**

4. **Question**: How have you implemented multithreading in Python? What were the use cases?

   * **Answer**: I used Python’s **Threading** library to handle concurrent tasks in an application for real-time data collection.
