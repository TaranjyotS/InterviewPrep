Led data transformation projects using SAS, Pandas, and Airflow, enabling efficient data handling in microservice architectures.  
Built and optimized REST APIs for secure, scalable applications, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.  
Skills and Attributes:

I’m a proactive, results-oriented engineer who’s always looking for ways to improve processes and drive system optimization. With a strong background in object-oriented programming (OOP), microservices architecture, and cloud infrastructure like AWS, I enjoy taking on complex challenges and delivering clean, efficient code.

Additionally, I pride myself on being an excellent communicator and team player. Throughout my career, I’ve fostered a culture of collaboration by participating in peer reviews, mentoring junior developers, and working closely with QA and product teams to ensure project success. I’m passionate about learning and consistently explore new technologies and best practices to enhance my skill set.

In summary, I bring a combination of technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, and a collaborative mindset to the table. I’m eager to continue building applications that solve real-world problems while working closely with teams to deliver innovative solutions.

## **Summary of "RDBMS Analysis for Big Data using Elasticsearch"**

The research paper "RDBMS Analysis for Big Data using Elasticsearch" by Taranjyot Singh and Geetika Bhatia discusses the limitations of traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) for handling the growing volume and complexity of big data. It introduces Elasticsearch as a powerful alternative for analyzing large datasets efficiently. Elasticsearch, a search engine built on Lucene, provides near real-time search capabilities by using techniques like indexing, denormalization, and the inverted index.

The paper explains that unlike RDBMS, which struggles with unstructured or semi-structured data, Elasticsearch is schema-less and document-oriented, allowing for faster and more flexible data retrieval. The inverted index, a core concept in Elasticsearch, enables quick searches by mapping terms to their respective documents. The use of stopword lists and other optimization techniques further enhances search speed and relevancy.

This highlights several use cases for Elasticsearch, including as a general-purpose document store, an analysis tool, an auto-completer, a spell checker, and a warning engine. They also describe how Elasticsearch distributes data across multiple nodes using shards, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.

The paper concludes by suggesting future improvements for Elasticsearch, such as refining the stopword list, enhancing tokenization and normalization processes, and optimizing scoring functions for better search relevancy. Elasticsearch is positioned as a robust solution for big data analytics, providing efficient, scalable, and real-time search capabilities.
